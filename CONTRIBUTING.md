# Contributing to uBlacklist

This document provides guidelines for contributing to the project.

## Getting Started

### Before Creating Issues

**Please start with [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/iorate/ublacklist/discussions) instead of creating issues directly.**

- **🐛 [Bugs](https://github.com/iorate/ublacklist/discussions/new?category=bugs)** - Raise a bug report
- **💡 [Ideas](https://github.com/iorate/ublacklist/discussions/new?category=ideas)** - Suggest your feature idea

Issues are created from discussions after verification and approval.

### Before Creating Pull Requests

**For major changes, please start with a discussion first.**

For simple contributions like typo fixes, you can create a pull request directly.
