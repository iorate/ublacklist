[简体中文](README.zh-CN.md)

Blocks specific sites from appearing in Google search results

[Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublacklist/pncfbmialoiaghdehhbnbhkkgmjanfhe) / [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublacklist/) / [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ublacklist-for-safari/id1547912640) (for macOS and iOS, thanks to [Group-Leafy](https://github.com/HoneyLuka/uBlacklist/tree/safari-port/safari-project))

## Description

This extension prevents the sites you specify from appearing in Google search results.

You can add rules on search result pages, or on sites to be blocked by clicking the toolbar icon. Rules can be specified either by [match patterns](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-us/docs/mozilla/add-ons/webextensions/match_patterns) (e.g. `*://*.example.com/*`) or by [regular expressions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-us/docs/web/javascript/guide/regular_expressions) (e.g. `/example\.(net|org)/`).

You can synchronize rulesets across devices via cloud storage. At the moment, Google Drive and Dropbox are supported.

You can also subscribe to public rulesets. Some subscriptions are listed on the website:

\*1 Only if "Always play videos on Qwant.com" is turned off<br>
\*2 Only certain public instances are supported. If you want to add support for your own SearX/SearXNG search engine, edit `src/common/search-engines.ts` and build the extension manually

## For subscription providers

To publish a ruleset as a subscription, place a ruleset file encoded in UTF-8 on a suitable HTTP(S) server, and publish the URL. Here is an example hosted on GitHub:<br>
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iorate/ublacklist-example-subscription/master/uBlacklist.txt

In uBlacklist >=6.6.0 for _Chrome_, subscription links are available. To add a subscription with `name` and `url`, the following URL can be used as a shortcut to the options page:

```
https://iorate.github.io/ublacklist/subscribe?name={urlEncode(name)}&url={urlEncode(url)}
```

For the above example:<br>
https://iorate.github.io/ublacklist/subscribe?name=Example&url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fiorate%2Fublacklist-example-subscription%2Fmaster%2FuBlacklist.txt
