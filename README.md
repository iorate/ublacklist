# uBlacklist

Blocks specific sites from appearing in Google search results

[Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublacklist/pncfbmialoiaghdehhbnbhkkgmjanfhe) / [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublacklist/) / [Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ublacklist-for-safari/id1547912640) (by [Group-Leafy](https://github.com/HoneyLuka/uBlacklist/tree/safari-port/safari-project))

## Description

This browser extension prevents blacklisted sites from appearing in Google search results.

You can add rules on search result pages, or on sites to be blocked by clicking the toolbar icon. Rules can be specified either by [match patterns](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Match_patterns) (e.g. `*://*.example.com/*`) or by [regular expressions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions) (e.g. `/example\.(net|org)/`).

## For subscription providers

To publish a blacklist as a subscription, place a blacklist file encoded in UTF-8 on a suitable HTTP(S) server, and publish the URL. Here is [an example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iorate/ublacklist-example-subscription/master/uBlacklist.txt) hosted on GitHub.
